📊 Metrics Guide
DORA Metrics

Deployment Frequency: How often code is deployed to production
Lead Time: Time from code commit to production deployment
Change Failure Rate: Percentage of deployments causing failures
Recovery Time: Time to recover from production failures

Performance Scores

Productivity Score: Overall team productivity based on DORA metrics
Velocity Score: Development speed and throughput
Quality Score: Code quality and deployment reliability
Efficiency Score: Process efficiency and workflow optimization

Bottleneck Categories

Lead Time: Delays in code delivery pipeline
Deployment Quality: High failure rates in deployments
Deployment Frequency: Infrequent releases
Recovery Time: Slow incident response
Code Review Process: Delays in code review
Testing Process: Inefficient testing workflows
Team Velocity: Low development throughput

🔧 Configuration
Database Configuration
The application uses SQLite for data storage. The database file (devops_metrics.db) is automatically created on first run.
Customization
You can customize the analysis by modifying:

Threshold values in MLBottleneckDetector class
Scoring algorithms in MLWorkflowAnalyzer class
Recommendation rules in RecommendationEngine class
